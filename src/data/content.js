export default `We specialize in truck repair. Our goal is to create great customer relationships by adding service, providing specific truck repair mechanical services, increasing vehicle availability through high quality preventative maintenance, and by performing correct repairs the first time around. All vehicle maintenance is carried out by certified repair technicians. This brings your, the customer, a certain level of confidence when you are needing truck repair. If a mechanic has no training or certification, it leaves open the possibility that the job will not be done correctly. Since your truck is required to help you make it in your profession, it is definitely not something you want to take lightly. You only want a trained and certified mechanic working on your truck. When you are in need of a quality truck repair shop near you, you can rely on us.
