          The iPad is a remarkable piece of electronic equipment. Launched onto the digital market back in 2011, it
          changed the way we interact with a computer. It took a big bulky computer and reduced it down to a wafer thin
          device that can be used virtually anywhere. Gone were the days of sitting in a desk chair, using a keyboard
          and requiring constant power to the device. It also introduced a new need to repair the iPad screen as the
          advantage of mobility ushered in the liability of cracking the iPad screen.
